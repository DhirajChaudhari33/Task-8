## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters a task in the input field
2. Task is added to a JavaScript array (state management)
3. Tasks are rendered dynamically using `document.createElement()`
4. Event delegation is used for handling complete and delete actions
5. CSS classes are toggled to mark tasks as completed
